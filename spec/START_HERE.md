## 🔥 WHAT MAKES THIS SPECIAL

This isn't a demo or mockup - these are **REAL smart contracts**!

- Same Solidity code that runs on mainnet
- Real transactions on local blockchain
- Real ERC20 tokens (USDT)
- Real ERC721 NFTs (properties)
- Real amortization calculations
- Real interest distributions

The only difference from production? It's running on your local Anvil instead of Base Sepolia!

---

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS

1. **Test locally** - Use this setup to test everything
2. **Deploy to testnet** - When ready, deploy to Base Sepolia
3. **Deploy to mainnet** - Final production deployment

For testnet deployment, see: `TESTNET_DEPLOY_GUIDE.md`
